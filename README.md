🚗 Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis 🔋

This project is part of my **Data Science Minor Project** for the course **INT375: Data Science Toolbox – Python Programming** at Lovely Professional University.

It focuses on the analysis and visualization of real-world electric vehicle (EV) registration data using Python and popular data science libraries.
